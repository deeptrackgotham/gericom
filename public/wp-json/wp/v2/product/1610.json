ECO1000 is a range of conventional detectors, which have been produced using the latest in manufacturing technology and supplied with an array of advanced features, making them &lsquo;better by design&rsquo;.<\/p>\n<p>The ECO1002 photoelectric smoke detector uses a state of the art optical chamber combined with an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to provide quick and accurate detection of fires. A combination of the unique chamber design and other technically advanced features will significantly extend the service intervals beforecleaning of the detector becomes necessary.<\/p>\n<p>A laser-based hand held Remote Test Unit can be used in conjunction with the range of ECO1000 detectors for alarm test purposes. The unit transmits a coded message, preventing spurious alarms being generated by other laser-based devices. With a range of several metres, the hand held test unit provides a fast and simple way of remotely alarm testing the range of ECO1000 detectors and removes the need for any direct physical access to the detector by the user. The ECO1002 detector has an integral LED, which illuminates to provide a local alarm signal. This latches on, and remains illuminated until the detector is reset by a momentary power interruption. An optional remote LED annunciator may be used to repeat any alarm signal.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of detector bases can be used with the ECO1002 detector,providing application flexibility and compatibility with a wide range of Fire Alarm Control Panels. All bases are fitted with a shorting spring to permit circuit testing prior to fitting the detector and have a tamper resistant feature, which when activated prevents removal of the detector without the use of a tool<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<ul>\n<li>Low profile design<\/li>\n<li>Low current draw<\/li>\n<li>Automatic drift compensation<\/li>\n<li>Operates on 12 and 24VDC Systems<\/li>\n<li>Remote alarm test feature<\/li>\n<li>Easy Maintenance<\/li>\n<li>Range of detector bases available<\/li>\n<li>Remote LED Option<\/li>\n<li>Approved to EN54 &ndash; 7:2000 (Amendment 1)<\/li>\n<li>EN54 &ndash; 5:2000 (Amendment 1) Class A1R; CEA 4021<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":741,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0},"product_cat":[69,68],"product_tag":[687,150],"class_list":{"0":"post-1610","1":"product","2":"type-product","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"product_cat-detectors","7":"product_cat-fire","8":"product_tag-eco1002","9":"product_tag-system-sensor","11":"first","12":"instock","13":"shipping-taxable","14":"purchasable","15":"product-type-simple"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product\/1610","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/product"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1610"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/741"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1610"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"product_cat","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat?post=1610"},{"taxonomy":"product_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_tag?post=1610"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
