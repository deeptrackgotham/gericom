With 24\/7 central station monitoring, residents are guaranteed protection whether they are away from home, sleeping, or already suffering from the effects of CO.<\/p>\n<p>The CO1224 Series detectors are designed for system operation. These detectors are fully listed to UL 2075 (US models only) and CSA 6.19-01 (Canada model only) and offer a code-required trouble relay to send a sensor failure or end-of-life signal to the control panel and the central station. The CO1224 Series detectors also use SEMS-type terminal Philips head screws for quicker and more positive wiring connections and code-required wiring supervision. With a low current draw, these detectors enable more devices to be connected to the panel, limiting the need to purchase extra power supplies or more expensive panels. As 12\/24 VDC detectors, the CO1224 Series detectors will operate on most industry security and fi re alarm control panels.<\/p>\n<p>With RealTest\u00ae technology, the CO gas sensing cell used in the CO1224 Series CO detectors can be tested using a CO gas agent, fully meeting the requirements of NFPA 720: 2009 (US models only). Simply put the detector into RealTest mode, spray a small amount of CO into the detector per the installation instructions, and within seconds the detector will alarm, indicating successful gas entry<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<ul>\n<li>A 10-year end-of-life timer<\/li>\n<li>RealTest\u00ae enables a functional test using canned CO<\/li>\n<li>A code-required trouble relay<\/li>\n<li>Wiring supervision with SEMS terminals<\/li>\n<li>12\/24 VDC<\/li>\n<li>A low current draw of 20 mA in standby and 40 mA in alarm<\/li>\n<li>Versatile mounting for wall and ceiling<\/li>\n<li>Accurate and reliable electrochemical sensing technology<\/li>\n<li>Optional CO-PLATE CO Detector Replacement Plate to upgrade previously installed competitor detectors to the CO1224T or CO1224A.<\/li>\n<li>CO1224T tested up to 12,000 feet above sea level<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":489,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0},"product_cat":[126,68],"product_tag":[157,158,70,159,160,148,149,150,161,162],"class_list":{"0":"post-1498","1":"product","2":"type-product","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"product_cat-accessories-fire","7":"product_cat-fire","8":"product_tag-carbon","9":"product_tag-co1224tr","10":"product_tag-detector","11":"product_tag-monoxide","12":"product_tag-realtest","13":"product_tag-sensor","14":"product_tag-system","15":"product_tag-system-sensor","16":"product_tag-technology","17":"product_tag-with","19":"first","20":"instock","21":"shipping-taxable","22":"purchasable","23":"product-type-simple"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product\/1498","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/product"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1498"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/489"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1498"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"product_cat","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat?post=1498"},{"taxonomy":"product_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imaxcameras.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_tag?post=1498"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
